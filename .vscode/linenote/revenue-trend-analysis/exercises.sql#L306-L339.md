The template query contains the code from the previous example. Modify it to show the revenue change as a percentage that's rounded to three decimal places.

$\frac{total\ amount\ -\ total\ amount\ from\ preceding\  quarters}{total\ amount\ from\ preceding\ quarters}$ $\times 100$
â€‹

Remember to round the result to three decimal places.
