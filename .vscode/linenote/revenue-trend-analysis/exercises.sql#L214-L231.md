Run the template query.

As you can see, we've got rows showing three aggregation levels: the grand total revenue, annual revenues, and the quarterly revenues for each year.

In other words, now you can see:

1. the grand total revenue – the total sum for all years (revenue_year and revenue_quarter being NULL).
2. the annual revenues – the sums for each year (revenue_quarter being NULL).
3. the sums for each year and quarter (being the results of the query from the pevious exercise).
