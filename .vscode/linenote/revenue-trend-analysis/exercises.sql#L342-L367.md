For each month of 2017, calculate the total monthly revenue from orders shipped to the USA and the percentage revenue change (delta) as compared to the previous month. Show three columns: `revenue_month`, `total_revenue`, and `delta_percentage`.

In the first row, leave the delta value as `NULL`. Order the rows by month. Here's how you can count `delta_percentage`:

$\frac{total\ amount\ -\ total\ amount\ from\ preceding\ months}{total\ amount\ from\ preceding\ months}$ $\times 100$

Remember to round the result to the second decimal point.
